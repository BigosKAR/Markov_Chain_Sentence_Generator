In an old house in Paris that was covered with vines lived twelve little girls in two straight lines. In two straight lines they broke their bread and brushed their teeth and went to bed. They left the house at half past nine in two straight lines in rain or shine - the smallest one was Madeline. She was not afraid of mice, she loved winter, snow, and ice. To the tiger in the zoo Madeline just said, 'Pooh-pooh'. And nobody knew so well how to frighten Miss Clavel. In the middle of one night Miss Clavel turned on her light and said, 'Something is not right!'
